        "1. When you meet someone outside, salute as soon as you recognize that he or she is an officer (when about six steps away). When overtaking an officer from behind, make every effort to identify their rank and salute as soon as you recognize that he or she is an officer.\n\n", 
        "2. Salute all officers (recognized by rank) in official vehicles identified by special plates or flags.\n\n", 
        "3. Salute only on command when in formation.\n\n", 
        "4. If in a group (not a formation) and an officer approaches, the first Cadet to recognize the officer calls the group to attention and the Cadet who called attention renders a salute.\n\n", 
        "5. If you approach an officer while you are double-timing alone, assume quick time march and render the hand salute. When the salute is returned, execute order arms and resume double-timing. When running for fitness, Cadets are not required to stop running to render a hand salute, however, a greeting is still appropriate.\n\n", 
        "6. The salute is always initiated by the subordinate and is terminated only after acknowledgement by the individual being saluted.\n\n", 
        "7. Accompany the salute with an appropriate greeting, such as, Good morning/afternoon Sir/Ma'am as appropriate. Additionally, cadets may greet with Rock Chalk Sir/Ma’am which they will also render when saluting; the response will be JayHawk!\n\n", 
        "8. Soldiers/cadets are not required to render salutes to persons driving or riding in privately owned vehicles.\n\n", 
        "9. It is not customary for enlisted personnel to exchange salutes, except in ceremonial situations.\n\n", 
        "10. Never render a salute with an object in your mouth or right hand.\n\n", 
        "11. If you are on detail and an officer approaches, the person in charge of the detail will present the greeting and salute while the detail continues to work.  If you are addressed by the officer, then come to attention and answer the officer's request.\n\n", 
        "12. Soldiers and cadets will render the hand salute to Medal of Honor recipients regardless of rank.\n\n", 
        "13. Salutes are not required when :\n", 
        "a. Indoors, except when reporting to an officer or when on duty as a guard.\n\n", 
        "b. Addressing a prisoner.\n\n",  
        "c. Saluting is obviously inappropriate. In these cases, only greetings are exchanged. (Example: A person carrying articles with both hands or being otherwise so occupied as to make saluting impracticable, is not required to salute a senior person or return the salute to a subordinate.)\n\n\n"

The following visible signs of respect and self-discipline will help you conduct yourself appropriately in the presence of officers and noncommissioned officers:\n\n",  
        "1. When speaking with or being addressed by an officer, stand at attention until ordered otherwise. When you are dismissed, or when the officer departs, come to attention and salute.\n\n",  
        "2. When speaking with or being addressed by a noncommissioned officer, stand at parade rest until ordered otherwise.\n\n",  
        "3. When an officer enters a room, the first Soldier to recognize the officer calls personnel in the room to attention. If alone in the room, stand at attention and give the appropriate greeting.\n\n",  
        "4. When an NCO enters the room, the first person to recognize the NCO calls the room to “At Ease!” If alone in the room, stand at attention and give the appropriate greeting.\n\n",  
        "5. Walk on the left of an officer, NCO, or cadet of superior rank, the right most position is the place of honor.\n\n",  
        "6. When outdoors and approached by an officer or NCO, come to the appropriate position and render the appropriate courtesies, salute and greet officers and greet NCOs.\n\n",  
        "7. The officer or NCO may give the directive “Carry On.” This means that Soldier or Soldiers should continue with whatever they were doing previously. This same directive is used in many situations outside of formation, such as in the barracks and break areas.\n\n",  
        "8. When you report to an officer or NCO, approach the person to whom you are reporting and stop about two steps from them and assume the position of attention. Salute and say, for example, “Sir/Sergeant, Cadet Smith reports.” If you are indoors, use the same procedures as above, except remove your headgear before reporting. If you are armed do not remove your headgear.\n\n",  
        "9. A cadet addressing an officer uses the words sir or ma'am. In the case of NCOs and Soldiers, you address them by their rank.\n\n", 
        "10. Simple courtesy is an important indicator or a person’s bearing, discipline, and manners. You may substitute the greeting with our unit motto, “Rock Chalk.” This reiterates pride in the unit and demonstrates discipline and professionalism of the unit’s Cadets.\n\n\n"
